# DaikinSkyportToMQTT
A bridge between the Daikin Skyport API and an MQTT broker. Runs as a Docker container.
Future development will take place at tjcoffey/SkySpy for a more integrated solution from the Skyport API to a Grafana dashboard. Leaving this up in case it's useful to someone with an existing MQTT broker. SkySpy is recommended if you're standing up from scratch.
